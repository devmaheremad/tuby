### - Introduction about Tuby:

Tuby is a platform for watching YouTube videos without ads (it gets data from RapidAPI), Tuby is super fast to display content and doesn't show any video that is out of your interest

#### - What I used technologies to build Tuby?

The important things I used to create Tuby are (ReactJS v18.2.0, TypeScript 4.9, JavaScript, Material UI v5.11.1, State Management ( Zustand ), RapidAPIs, and more...)

#### - Setup and using it:

To install Tuby to your computer it's easy you can clone it and just type `npm i` to your terminal
Do what you need to add to it or update it or anything you need and update it again
It's so welcomed to work with me to add new features to it
